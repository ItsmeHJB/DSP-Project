just got gazemap production up and working after a long fight
need to get working on the CNN too, but hopefully it should be fairly straight forward using TF as there are many tuts

Need to talk about:
 - headset (running out of time to try it out too)
 - draft of paper
 - need consent form to gather data from household - where to start
 - experimentation and varying deatils like eye area detection and getting info out of python to plug into code


initial design to allow the app to take in other systems, but we might not get the iteration
	have a look at headset code to see how it outputs
we can say the report is very ambitious and there's plenty of scope to continue and work it on other times
fine to do it with my household in a safe way, get some results would be great but it isn't necessary

no personal data stored and eye data isn't stored - remind Jim for an ethics review / approval sheet is required - email

draft submission - 19th. latest = before the weekend submission

memory requirements - will the eye tracker run on smaller systems or will it have some errors due to a lack of memory
	Need to check how fast it fills up - will need to kill activate if it goes too wild
idea to get eye tracker process to ask processor and store its eye tracker process ID . when button pressed in activate, system signal command to program to stop recording
!!!!!!!! check for existance of file every few seconds and keep running it until activate kills it by deleting it.
!!!!!!!! processor signal is an option, but I'm not sure how that will work
^ include on the could option

talk about getting the eye tracker to wait on a selection etc - future idea, very out of scope

waiting on email from Jim with questions about things it could do/what needs to be added on
